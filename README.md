🤖 Hello This is icabette' repository for all personal projects.

🏫 I am currently learning on Python and Kotlin. My next goal is to make MQTT server using python.

🎞️ I am interested in watching movie and drama. 🖥️ I play the classic avdenture game when I take a rest. My favorite #1 is "Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis".

Happy Programming!
